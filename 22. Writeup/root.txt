#10.10.10.138

just run the linenum.sh script on  '/tmp' folder of server -> nothing special found

if we check running process for root user
cmd>  ps aux | grep roo

we found that cron job is running 
to check what it is executing we use 'pspy64' in '/tmp'
just upload it on server and run using 'bash' because it will not directly run 

cmd>  bash pspy64

Now if we open new ssh connection then we can see in pspy64 that a 'run-parts' command is executing
and if we check that where it is located , inside '/bin' directory
cmd> which run-parts  --> /bin/run-parts

but if we check the '$PATH' value then 
cmd>  echo $PATH  --> /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games

 '/usr/local/bin' is executing before '/bin' so what if we create new 'run-parts' binary inside '/usr/local/bin' with reverse shell using 'python' interpreter

 so it will execute our 'run-parts' binary before original one.

 check 'run-parts' file.

 start listner on 4444

start new ssh connection
#USER:   jkr
#PASSWD: raykayjay9

got the shell......
